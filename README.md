# USAGE

Start the docker container (using something like the
`docker run` command in `docker.sh`).
Enter it                   (using something like the
`docker exec` command in `docker.sh`).
Run `cd` to go to the home folder (`/home/ubuntu`).

Pick an executable from `Cargo.toml`.
Supposing for this paragraph you picked `via-tantivy`,
then you would run `cargo run --bin via-tantivy`.
